Currently, p4wnparse uses several scripts to perform specific lookup tasks.

Here are the scripts currently in p4wnparse (as of Dec 8, 2021):

1. ‚òéÔ∏è p4wnparse-phone-callprotect.py --- Give it a Phone Number, it'll give you their Name

2. üßë p4wnparse-name-clustrmaps.py --- Give it a Name, it'll give you their Info (Age, etc)

3. üßë p4wnparse-name-radaris.py --- Give it a Name, it'll give you their Info (Age, etc)

## How it Works:

- Give the corresponding script a Name / Phone number

- The script fetches and scrapes a website

- The results are displayed

## Install:

First, clone the p4wnparse Github repository:

`git clone https://github.com/p4wnsolo/p4wnsolo-pawnparse.git`
